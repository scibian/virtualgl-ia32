* Configuring a Windows Machine as a VGL Transport Client

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
Cygwin/X to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can significantly
improve the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline when running over a
local-area network.

To enable MIT-SHM in Cygwin/X:

	#. Open a Cygwin Bash shell

	#. Run ''cygserver-config''

	#. Answer "yes" when asked "Do you want to install cygserver as service?"

	#. From a Windows (not Cygwin) command prompt, run ''net start cygserver''

	#. Add ''server'' to the ''CYGWIN'' system environment variable (create this
		environment variable if it doesn't already exist)

	#. Start or re-start Cygwin/X

	#. Run ''xdpyinfo'' and verify that ''MIT-SHM'' appears in the list of 
		X extensions
