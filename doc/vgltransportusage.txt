* Using VirtualGL with the VGL Transport
{anchor: VGL_Transport_Usage}

*** Advantages of the VGL Transport
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* Seamless windows; every application window appears as a separate window on
		the user's desktop
	* Supports stereographic rendering (see requirements in
		{ref prefix="Sections ": Stereo_Requirements} and
		{ref prefix="": Overlay_Requirements})
	* Consumes less memory and CPU time on the server, since the 2D (X11)
		rendering occurs on the client machine

*** Disadvantages of the VGL Transport
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* The VGL Transport is designed to be used with remote X servers, and thus it
		relies on the chatty remote X11 protocol to send the 2D elements of the
		application's GUI to the user's desktop.  As a result, the VGL Transport is
		not recommended for use on high-latency or low-bandwidth networks
	* No collaboration features
	* The client is not stateless.  As with any remote X11 environment, if the
		network connection drops, then the application will exit

** VGL Transport with X11 Forwarding
{anchor: X11_Forwarding}

This mode is recommended for use only on secure local-area networks.  The X11
traffic is encrypted, but the VGL Transport is left unencrypted to
maximize performance.

*** Procedure

	#. Start the X server if it isn't started already.{nl}
		__Mac clients:__ start the Mac X11 application or XQuartz.{nl}
		__Cygwin clients:__ start Cygwin/X.

	#. Open a new terminal window.{nl}
		__Mac clients:__ in the X11 application, start a new xterm [Command-N] if
			one isn't already started.{nl}
		__Cygwin clients:__ start a new xterm if one isn't already started
			(right-click on the Cygwin/X taskbar icon, then select
			__Applications-->xterm__.)

	#. In the same terminal/xterm window, open a Secure Shell (SSH) session into
		the VirtualGL server:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglconnect {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace __''{user}''__ with your username on the VirtualGL server and
		__''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that server.

	#. In the SSH session, start a 3D application using VirtualGL:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

	Consult {ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_Configuration} for more
	information on ''vglrun'' command-line options.

** VGL Transport with a Direct X11 Connection
{anchor: Direct_X11_Connection}

As with the previous mode, this mode performs optimally on
local-area networks.  However, it is less secure, since both the X11 traffic
and the VGL Transport are unencrypted.  This mode is primarily useful in
grid environments, in which you may not know ahead of time which server will
execute a VirtualGL job.  It is assumed that the "submit host" (the machine
into which you connect with SSH) and the "execute hosts" (the machines that
will run VirtualGL jobs) share the same home directories and reside in the same
domain.

	!!! Most newer Linux and Unix distributions ship with default settings
	that do not allow TCP connections into the X server.  Such systems cannot be
	used as clients with this procedure unless they are reconfigured to allow
	X11 TCP connections.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

The procedure for this mode is identical to the procedure for the
[[#X11_Forwarding][VGL Transport with X11 forwarding]], except that you should
pass a ''-x'' argument to ''vglconnect'' when connecting to the server:

	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglconnect -x {user}@{server}
	---

** VGL Transport with X11 Forwarding and SSH Tunneling
{anchor: SSH_Tunneling}

Both the VGL Transport and the X11 traffic are tunneled through SSH when
using this mode, and thus it provides a completely secure solution.  It is
also useful when either the VirtualGL server or the client machine are behind
restrictive firewalls and only SSH connections are allowed through.  Using
SSH tunneling on wide-area networks should not affect performance
significantly.  However, using SSH tunneling on a local-area network can reduce
the end-to-end performance of the VGL Transport by anywhere from 20-40%.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

The procedure for this mode is identical to the procedure for the
[[#X11_Forwarding][VGL Transport with X11 forwarding]], except that you should
pass a ''-s'' argument to ''vglconnect'' when connecting to the server:

	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglconnect -s {user}@{server}
	---

''vglconnect'' will make two SSH connections into the server, the first to find
an open port on the server and the second to create the SSH tunnel for the VGL Transport
and open the secure shell.  If you are not using an SSH agent to create
password-less logins, then this mode will require you to enter your password
twice.

''vglconnect -s'' can be used to create multi-layered SSH tunnels.  For
instance, if the VirtualGL server is not directly accessible from the Internet,
then you can run ''vglconnect -s'' on the client machine to connect to an
SSH gateway server, then you can run ''vglconnect -s'' again on the gateway
server to connect to the VirtualGL server (application server.)  Both the X11
traffic and the VGL Transport will be forwarded from the VirtualGL server
through the gateway and to the client.

** VGL Transport over Gigabit Networks

When using the VGL Transport over Gigabit Ethernet or faster networks, it may
be desirable to disable image compression.  This can be accomplished by passing
an argument of ''-c rgb'' to ''vglrun'' or setting the ''VGL_COMPRESS''
environment variable to ''rgb'' on the VirtualGL server.  Disabling image
compression will reduce VirtualGL's server and client CPU usage by 50% or more,
but the tradeoff is that it will also increase VirtualGL's network usage by a
factor of 10 or more.  Thus, disabling image compression is not recommended
unless you are using switched Gigabit Ethernet (or faster) infrastructure and
have plenty of bandwidth to spare.

** VGL Transport with XDMCP

	!!! XDMCP is very insecure and is not recommended as a means of running
	VirtualGL, in general.  This section is provided mainly for completeness and
	should not be construed as an endorsement of XDMCP.  In general, using an X
	proxy is a much better approach for accessing a remote desktop session on the
	3D application server.

Using the VGL Transport with XDMCP is conceptually similar to using
the VGL Transport with a
[[#Direct_X11_Connection][direct X11 connection]].  The major difference is
that, rather than remotely displaying individual X windows to the 2D X server,
XDMCP remotely displays a complete desktop session from the application server.
X11 applications are launched inside of this remote desktop session rather than
in a separate shell, so ''vglconnect'' cannot be used in this case.  Instead,
it is necessary to start ''vglclient'' manually on the client machine.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Configure the server machine to accept XDMCP connections.  This may
		require opening specific ports in its firewall.

	#. Configure the client machine to make XDMCP connections.  This may require
		enabling X11 TCP connections and opening specific ports in its firewall.

	#. Once you have established an XDMCP connection from the client to the
		server, open a terminal inside the XDMCP session and type:

		#Verb: <<---
		xhost +LOCAL:
		---

		!!! This grants access to the 2D X server for any user that is currently
		logged into the client machine.  This is not very secure, but neither is
		using XDMCP.  If you are concerned, then
		see below for a discussion of how to use ''xauth'' to provide 2D X server
		access in a slightly more secure manner.

	#. If you are using a Mac or Windows client, or if you are using a nested X
		server (such as Xephyr or XNest) on a Linux/Unix client to make the XDMCP
		connection, then the next step is easy.  Simply open a new terminal/command
		prompt on the client machine, set the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable to
		the display name of the X server that is running the XDMCP session (usually
		'':0'' or '':1''), and type:

		#Verb: <<---
		vglclient -detach
		---

		You can now close the terminal/command prompt, if you wish.

	#. If you are running a full-screen XDMCP session on a Linux/Unix client
		(for instance, using GDM Chooser), then starting ''vglclient'' is a bit
		trickier.  In this case, you can't open up a separate terminal window on
		the client machine for the purposes of running ''vglclient''.  However,
		from inside of the XDMCP session, you can open an SSH session back into the
		client machine.  In this SSH session, set the ''DISPLAY'' environment
		variable to the display name of the X server that is running the XDMCP
		session (usually '':0'' or '':1''), and type:

		#Verb: <<---
		vglclient -detach
		---

		You can now close the SSH session, if you wish.

*** Security
#OPT: noList! plain!

Typing ''xhost +LOCAL:'' in step 3 above opens the 2D X server to all current
users of the client machine.  This shouldn't pose any significant risk if the
client is a Windows or a Mac machine.  However, Linux/Unix clients might have
multiple simultaneous users, so in these cases, it may be desirable to use a
more secure method of granting access to the 2D X server.

Instead of typing ''xhost +LOCAL:'', you can type the following:

#Verb: <<---
xauth nextract - $DISPLAY | sed "s/.*[ ]//g" | xargs ssh {client} xauth add {display} .
---

where __''{client}''__ is the hostname or IP address of the client machine and
__''{display}''__ is the display name of the 2D X server, from the point of
view of the client machine (usually '':0'' or '':1'').

This extracts the XAuth key for the 2D X server, then remotely adds it to the
XAuth keyring on the client machine.

** The VirtualGL Client Application: Nuts and Bolts

The VirtualGL Client application (''vglclient'') receives encoded and/or
compressed images on a dedicated TCP socket, decodes and/or decompresses the
images, and draws the images into the appropriate X window.  The ''vglconnect''
script wraps both ''vglclient'' and SSH to greatly simplify the process of
creating VGL Transport connections.

''vglconnect'' invokes ''vglclient'' with an argument of ''-detach'', which
causes ''vglclient'' to completely detach from the console and run as a
background daemon.  It will remain running silently in the background,
accepting VGL Transport connections for the X server on which it was started,
until that X server is reset or until the ''vglclient'' process is explicitly
killed.  Logging out of the X server will reset the X server and thus kill all
''vglclient'' instances that are attached to it.  You can also explicitly kill
all instances of ''vglclient'' running under your user account by invoking

	#Verb: <<---
	vglclient -kill
	---

(''vglclient'' is installed in ''/opt/VirtualGL/bin'' by default.)

''vglconnect'' instructs ''vglclient'' to redirect all of its console output
to a log file named
__''{home}''__''/.vgl/vglconnect-''__''{hostname}''__''-''__''{display}''__''.log'',
where __''{home}''__ is the path of the current user's home directory,
__''{hostname}''__ is the name of the computer running ''vglconnect'', and
__''{display}''__ is the name of the current X display (read from the
''DISPLAY'' environment or passed to ''vglconnect'' using the ''-display''
argument.)  In the event that something goes wrong, this log file is the first
place to check.

When ''vglclient'' successfully starts on a given X display, it stores its
listener port number in a root window property on the X display.  If
other ''vglclient'' instances attempt to start on the same X display, they read
the X window property, determine that another ''vglclient'' instance is
already running, and exit to allow the first instance to retain control.
''vglclient'' will clean up the X property under most circumstances, even
if it is explicitly killed.  However, under rare circumstances (if sent a
SIGKILL signal on Unix, for instance), a ''vglclient'' instance may exit
uncleanly and leave the X property set.  In these cases, it may be necessary
to add an argument of ''-force'' to ''vglconnect'' the next time you use it.
This tells ''vglconnect'' to start a new ''vglclient'' instance, regardless of
whether ''vglclient'' thinks that there is already an instance running on this
X display.  Alternately, you can simply reset your X server to clear the
orphaned X window property.

*** The VirtualGL Client and Firewalls

To retain compatibility with previous versions of VirtualGL, the first
''vglclient'' instance on a given machine will attempt to listen on port 4242
for unencrypted connections and 4243 for SSL connections (if VirtualGL was
built with OpenSSL support.)  If it fails to obtain one of those ports, because
another application or another ''vglclient'' instance is already using them,
then ''vglclient'' will try to obtain a free port in the range of 4200-4299.
Failing that, it will request a free port from the operating system.

In a nutshell: if you only ever plan to run one X server at a time on your
client machine, which means that you'll only ever need one instance of
''vglclient'' at a time, then it is sufficient to open inbound port 4242 (and
4243 if you plan to use SSL) in your client machine's firewall.  If you plan to
run multiple X servers on your client machine, which means that you will need
to run multiple ''vglclient'' instances, then you may wish to open ports
4200-4299.  Similarly, if you are running ''vglclient'' on a multi-user
X proxy server that has a firewall, then you may wish to open ports 4200-4299
in the server's firewall.  Opening ports 4200-4299 will accommodate up to 100
separate ''vglclient'' instances (50 if OpenSSL support is enabled.)  More
instances than that cannot be accommodated on a firewalled machine, unless the
firewall is able to create rules based on application executables instead of
listening ports.

Note that it is not necessary to open any inbound ports in the firewall to use
the VGL Transport with [[#SSH_Tunneling][SSH Tunneling]].
