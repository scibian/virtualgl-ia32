* Obtaining and Installing VirtualGL

	!!! VirtualGL must be installed on any machine that will act as a VirtualGL
	server or as a client for the [[overview.txt#VGL_Transport][VGL Transport]].
	It is not necessary to install VirtualGL on the client machine if using VNC
	or another type of X proxy.

** Installing VirtualGL on Linux

	1. Download the appropriate VirtualGL binary package for your system from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].
		Packages are provided for RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions
		that contain GLIBC 2.3.4 or later (including
		[[http://fedoraproject.org][Fedora]] 4 or later,
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[http://www.centos.org/][CentOS]] \
		4 or later,
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise/[[http://www.opensuse.org][openSUSE]] 10 or later,
		and [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] 6.06 or later.)
		{nl}
		!!! If you want to run both 32-bit and 64-bit OpenGL applications using
		VirtualGL on 64-bit Linux systems, then you will need to install both the
		i386 and x86_64 VirtualGL RPMs or both the "virtualgl" and "virtualgl32"
		amd64 DEBs.  (The virtualgl32 DEB is a supplementary package that contains
		only the 32-bit server components.)

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the binary
		package, and issue the following commands:

		RPM-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL
		rpm -i VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		!!! You may need to add ''--all-matches'' to the ''rpm -e'' command line if
		you have installed both the 32-bit and 64-bit VirtualGL RPMs.

		Debian-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		dpkg -i virtualgl*.deb
		---

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on OS X

	#. Download the VirtualGL Mac disk image
		(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac client.

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on Windows (Cygwin)

Refer to [[http://www.virtualgl.org/Documentation/Cygwin]].

** Installing VirtualGL from Source

If you are using a platform for which there is not a pre-built VirtualGL binary
package available, then download the VirtualGL source tarball
(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, ''cd VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__, and read the contents of
''BUILDING.txt'' for further instructions on how to build and install VirtualGL
from source.
