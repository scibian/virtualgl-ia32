* System Requirements

** Linux/x86 and Other x86 Un*x Operating Systems

|| || Server (x86) || Server (x86-64) || Client ||
| Recommended CPU \
	| {list type=ul: \
			{item:For optimal performance, the CPU should support SSE2 \
				extensions.} \
			{item:Dual processors or dual cores recommended}} \
	| Dual processors or dual cores recommended \
	| For optimal performance, the CPU should support SSE2 extensions. \
	|
| Graphics \
	| AMD or nVidia GPU \
		{list type=ul: \
			{item:For optimal performance, particularly with multiple simultaneous \
				users, a professional-grade GPU such as the AMD FirePro or nVidia \
				Quadro is recommended.} \
			{item:Install the AMD or nVidia proprietary drivers.  Open source \
				drivers for these GPUs do not generally provide full 3D acceleration, \
				and some of those drivers do not provide Pbuffer support.}} \
	| < \
	| Any graphics adapter with decent 2D performance \
		{list type=ul: \
			{item:If using a 3D graphics adapter, install the vendor drivers for \
				that 3D graphics adapter.}} \
	|
| O/S \
	| VirtualGL should work with a variety of Linux distributions, \
		[[http://www.freebsd.org][FreeBSD]], and \
		[[http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/solaris][Solaris]], \
		but currently-supported versions of \
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] \
		(and its work-alikes, including [[http://www.centos.org][CentOS]], \
		[[http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/linux][Oracle Linux]], and \
		[[https://www.scientificlinux.org][Scientific Linux]]), \
		[[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] LTS, and [[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] \
		Linux Enterprise tend to receive the most attention from the VirtualGL \
		community. \

** Additional Requirements for Stereographic Rendering
{anchor: Stereo_Requirements}

	!!! The client requirements do not apply to anaglyphic stereo.  See
	{ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_OpenGL} for more details.

|| || Server || Client ||
| Linux/Unix \
	| {list type=ul: \
			{item:AMD or nVidia GPU that supports stereo (examples: AMD FirePro W \
				Series, nVidia Quadro)} \
			{item:The 3D X server should be configured to export stereo visuals.}} \
	| {list type=ul: \
			{item:GPU that supports stereo} \
			{item:The 2D X server should be configured to export stereo visuals.}} \
	|
| Mac/x86 \
	| N/A \
	| GPU that supports stereo (example: nVidia Quadro) \
	|
| Windows \
	| N/A \
	| This version of VirtualGL does not support remote quad-buffered stereo \
		with Windows clients. \

#OPT: hiCol=first

** Additional Requirements for Transparent Overlays
{anchor: Overlay_Requirements}

|| || Client ||
| Linux/Unix \
	| GPU that supports transparent overlays.  The 2D X server should be \
			configured to export overlay visuals. \
	|
| Mac/x86 \
	| ^ \
	|
| Windows \
	| This version of VirtualGL does not support transparent overlays with \
		Windows clients. \
